ðŸ“º YouTube Tutorial: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Av44Nrhl05s


_**Project Overview:**_
This project is an end-to-end data solution built using Microsoft Fabric. It demonstrates data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, and visualization workflows with earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API.

_**Architecture:**_
Data Ingestion: Retrieved real-time earthquake data using Python and the USGS API.
Data Processing: Developed:
Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion and storage.
Silver Layer: Data cleansing and preparation.
Gold Layer: Fully processed, analytics-ready data.
Data Orchestration: Leveraged Data Factory pipelines to automate workflows.
Visualization: Designed Power BI dashboards for exploring earthquake trends.
_**Key Technologies:**_
Microsoft Fabric Workspace: Data collaboration and processing.
Python: For API integration and layered data processing.
Data Factory: Workflow orchestration.
Power BI: Interactive dashboards for visual analysis.

_**Steps Covered:**_
Fetch data using Pythonâ€™s requests library.
Process data in Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers using Python Notebooks.
Build and automate workflows with Data Factory.
Create insightful dashboards in Power BI.

This project is an excellent example of how to leverage Microsoft Fabric to integrate and process large-scale data efficiently. Check out the repository and tutorial for more details!
