**End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project**
_Project Overview:_ 
This project builds a scalable and efficient Azure-based data engineering pipeline for end-to-end data processing. 
The use case involves ingesting data from an on-premise SQL Server, transforming it into analytics-ready formats, and visualizing it with Power BI dashboards.

_Architecture Components:_
Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates workflows for data ingestion.
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: Stores raw and processed data.
Azure Databricks: Cleans and transforms data using Spark.
Azure Synapse Analytics: Serves as the data warehouse for clean data.
Power BI: Generates interactive dashboards for insights.
Azure Key Vault & AAD: Provides governance and secure access.

_Technical Highlights:_
Built ETL pipelines using Azure services.
Transformed raw data into structured formats with Apache Spark.
Designed and deployed Power BI dashboards for real-time insights.
Implemented Azure Key Vault and Active Directory for secure data management.
