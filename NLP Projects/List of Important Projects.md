## GeekForGeeks Projects (Completed, and On-going)
### 1. Text Summarization
Developed an NLP-based text summarization tool that automatically condenses long pieces of text into concise summaries, preserving essential information and key points. This project leverages techniques like extractive and abstractive summarization to enhance readability and efficiency.


### 2. Fake News Detector
Built a machine learning model to identify and classify fake news articles based on their content. This project involved preprocessing news data, training a classification model, and using linguistic features to distinguish between real and fake news, a valuable tool in combating misinformation.


### 3. Spam SMS Classification
Implemented a spam detection model to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) based on message content. Using supervised learning techniques, this project improved SMS filtering and security by recognizing patterns in spam messages.


### 4. Toxic Comments Classification
Created a model to detect toxic and harmful comments in online discussions. This project involved building a text classification pipeline to identify abusive language, hate speech, and other negative comments, contributing to safer online environments.


### 5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Designed an NER model to identify and classify entities like names, organizations, dates, and locations in text data. This project focused on extracting relevant entities for applications in information retrieval and automated content tagging.


### 6. Generating Research Paper Titles
Developed an NLP tool that generates research paper titles based on a given topic or abstract. This project explored the use of generative models in creating creative, context-appropriate titles, which could assist researchers in brainstorming and refining their ideas.


### 7. Spell and Grammar Checking
Created a tool to check and correct spelling and grammar in text, mimicking popular spell-checking applications. This project involved language model-based error detection and suggestion generation to enhance writing quality.


### 8. Sentence Autocomplete
Built a sentence autocompletion tool that predicts the next word or phrase based on the context of the input. This project leveraged language models to assist in faster typing and improve user experience in text entry tasks.


### 9. Chatbot Using NLP
Developed a simple rule-based or machine learning-based chatbot capable of understanding and responding to basic queries. This project included natural language understanding (NLU) techniques to interpret user input and generate contextually appropriate responses.

### 10. Sentiment Analysis with Python
Created a sentiment analysis tool to classify text data by emotional tone (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). This project involved training a model to identify sentiment in text, making it useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media, and more.
