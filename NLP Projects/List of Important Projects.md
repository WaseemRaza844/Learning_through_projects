## NLP Projects for Begineers (Completed)

### P01. - ML Sentence Classification
Developed a sentence classification model using traditional machine learning techniques (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression) to classify sentences into different categories. This project demonstrates foundational knowledge in text processing, feature extraction (like TF-IDF), and the application of machine learning models to classify text data.

### P02. - DL Sentence Classification
Created a deep learning-based sentence classification model, utilizing neural network architectures such as RNNs, LSTMs, or CNNs. This project explores advanced techniques for handling sequential text data, showcasing experience with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for implementing NLP models.

### P03. - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Built an NER model to identify and classify entities (e.g., names, organizations, locations) within text. This project uses machine learning or deep learning techniques to extract and categorize key information from text, which can be applied in domains like information retrieval, customer support automation, and content analysis.

### P04. - Machine Translation
Developed a simple machine translation model to translate sentences from one language to another. This project likely uses sequence-to-sequence models, such as encoder-decoder architectures, to perform text translation, demonstrating skills in multilingual NLP and deep learning for text.

### P05. - Text Generation
Implemented a text generation model to generate coherent sentences or paragraphs based on a prompt. This project may use techniques like RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers for generating human-like text, showcasing experience with natural language generation tasks.


## Natural Language Proecessing

### P01. - Fake News Classification
Developed a model to detect and classify news articles as real or fake. This project involved feature extraction from text data, data preprocessing, and training a classification model to distinguish between reliable and unreliable news sources. It showcases skills in text classification, model evaluation, and handling imbalanced data.

### P02. - Movies Genre Classification
Built a model to classify movies into specific genres based on textual descriptions or summaries. This project likely involved feature engineering and the use of machine learning algorithms to predict single-genre labels for movies, helping improve recommendation systems and content categorization.

### P03. - Movie Genre Classification with Multi-label Output
An advanced version of genre classification, this project involves multi-label classification, where each movie can belong to multiple genres. The project demonstrates familiarity with multi-label techniques, a useful skill for complex classification tasks in real-world applications like content recommendation.

### P04. - Spam SMS Classification
Created a model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. This project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and building a binary classifier to detect spam messages, a common application in filtering unwanted communications.

### P05. - Sentiment Analysis - Dow Jones (DJIA) Stock using News Headlines
Conducted sentiment analysis on news headlines related to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) to predict stock market trends. This project combines sentiment analysis with financial data insights, showing the ability to derive actionable insights from news sentiment for financial forecasting.

### P06. - Sentiment Analysis - Restaurant Reviews
Built a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews for restaurants as positive, negative, or neutral. This project demonstrates skills in text analysis and customer feedback interpretation, which are useful for improving user experience and service quality in the hospitality industry.

## GeekForGeeks Projects (Completed, and On-going)
### P01. Text Summarization
Developed an NLP-based text summarization tool that automatically condenses long pieces of text into concise summaries, preserving essential information and key points. This project leverages techniques like extractive and abstractive summarization to enhance readability and efficiency.


### P02. - Fake News Detector
Built a machine learning model to identify and classify fake news articles based on their content. This project involved preprocessing news data, training a classification model, and using linguistic features to distinguish between real and fake news, a valuable tool in combating misinformation.


### P03. - Spam SMS Classification
Implemented a spam detection model to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) based on message content. Using supervised learning techniques, this project improved SMS filtering and security by recognizing patterns in spam messages.


### P04. - Toxic Comments Classification
Created a model to detect toxic and harmful comments in online discussions. This project involved building a text classification pipeline to identify abusive language, hate speech, and other negative comments, contributing to safer online environments.


### P05. - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Designed an NER model to identify and classify entities like names, organizations, dates, and locations in text data. This project focused on extracting relevant entities for applications in information retrieval and automated content tagging.


### P6. - Generating Research Paper Titles
Developed an NLP tool that generates research paper titles based on a given topic or abstract. This project explored the use of generative models in creating creative, context-appropriate titles, which could assist researchers in brainstorming and refining their ideas.


### P07. - Spell and Grammar Checking
Created a tool to check and correct spelling and grammar in text, mimicking popular spell-checking applications. This project involved language model-based error detection and suggestion generation to enhance writing quality.


### P08. - Sentence Autocomplete
Built a sentence autocompletion tool that predicts the next word or phrase based on the context of the input. This project leveraged language models to assist in faster typing and improve user experience in text entry tasks.


### P09. - Chatbot Using NLP
Developed a simple rule-based or machine learning-based chatbot capable of understanding and responding to basic queries. This project included natural language understanding (NLU) techniques to interpret user input and generate contextually appropriate responses.

### P10. - Sentiment Analysis with Python
Created a sentiment analysis tool to classify text data by emotional tone (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). This project involved training a model to identify sentiment in text, making it useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media, and more.
